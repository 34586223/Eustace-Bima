    "# Introduction to Data Science using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves using statistical methods, machine learning, and other techniques to extract insights from data. Python has become a popular programming language for data science due to its ease of use, large and active community, and extensive library support. In this technical report, we will provide an introduction to data science using Python programming language. The report will cover the following topics:\n",

    "Overview of Python Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language that is widely used for general-purpose programming. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and was released in 1991. Python has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability and reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python is also a powerful language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, game development, scientific computing, and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled before it can be run. This makes it easy to write and test code quickly. Python also has a large and active community, which has created a vast library of modules and packages that can be used for a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Manipulation with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Data manipulation is the process of changing or transforming data to make it more useful. Python provides several libraries and tools for data manipulation, including NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a library for scientific computing that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It also provides functions for mathematical operations, such as linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation. NumPy is used extensively in data science for numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides support for data structures such as data frames and series, and functions for data filtering, aggregation, and merging. Pandas is used extensively in data science for data wrangling and cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy is a library for scientific computing that provides support for optimization, signal processing, and statistical analysis. It provides functions for numerical integration, interpolation, and linear regression. SciPy is used extensively in data science for statistical analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Visualization with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is the process of creating graphical representations of data to make it easier to understand and interpret. Python provides several libraries and tools for data visualization, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a library for creating static, two-dimensional plots. It provides support for a wide range of plot types, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms. Matplotlib is used extensively in data science for creating visualizations of numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn is a library for creating statistical graphics. It provides support for more complex plot types, such as heat maps, cluster maps, and violin plots. Seaborn is used extensively in data science for creating visualizations of categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly is a library for creating interactive visualizations. It provides support for creating interactive plots that can be embedded in web pages or Jupyter notebooks. Plotly is used extensively in data science for creating visualizations that can be explored and interacted with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is the process of training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions. Python provides several libraries and tools for machine learning, including Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn is a library for machine learning that provides support for a wide range of algorithms, including regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It also provides functions for data preprocessing, cross-validation, and model selection. Scikit-learn is used extensively in data science for building\n"
